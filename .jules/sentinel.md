## 2024-05-24 - [Path Traversal in FAISS Deserialization]
**Vulnerability:** A path traversal vulnerability existed in `modules/validation.py` where a user-controlled `store_path` could be arbitrary directories. `FAISS.load_local` with `allow_dangerous_deserialization=True` would then load files from these arbitrary locations, resulting in a potential RCE risk.
**Learning:** Functions doing dangerous deserializations (like `pickle` in Python, heavily used by AI tools) must only ever operate on strictly validated paths that guarantee no user input can influence the location.
**Prevention:** Always validate user-provided paths with `os.path.commonpath([abs_vector_dir, abs_store]) == abs_vector_dir` before passing it to any IO functions, especially deserializations.

## 2024-05-24 - [CORS CSRF Vulnerability]
**Vulnerability:** The FastAPI backend used `allow_origins=["*"]` while setting `allow_credentials=True` in CORS configuration. This is a highly insecure combination that could allow Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via cross-origin requests holding credentials.
**Learning:** Using `*` for CORS origins is dangerous when `allow_credentials` is true because it permits any site to make authenticated requests to the API on behalf of the user. Most modern frameworks block this outright, but when bypassing those protections or configuring manually, it is a significant risk.
**Prevention:** Always restrict `allow_origins` to a specific list of trusted origins (like the frontend application's URL) when `allow_credentials=True`. Use environment variables to handle different environments (e.g., local dev vs. production).

## 2024-05-24 - [Confused Deputy Vulnerability in OAuth]
**Vulnerability:** In `backend/api/auth.py`, the Google login endpoint accepted Google ID tokens but did not verify the `aud` (audience) claim against the application's expected client ID. This allowed any valid Google token (even those issued to other apps) to authenticate successfully.
**Learning:** This is a classic "Confused Deputy" vulnerability. An attacker can obtain an OAuth token for a user using their own malicious app, and then submit that token to this API to log in as that user.
**Prevention:** Always verify the `aud` claim in incoming JWTs or OAuth tokens matches your application's client ID before trusting the token.
